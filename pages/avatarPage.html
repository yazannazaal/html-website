                            <p><strong>Plot:</strong>The story is set in the mid-22nd century on the lush, habitable moon Pandora. Humans are mining Pandora for a valuable mineral called unobtanium, which has led to tensions with the indigenous Na'vi people. The protagonist, Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), is a paraplegic former Marine who is chosen to participate in the Avatar Program. In this program, human consciousness is linked to a genetically engineered Na'vi body, allowing Jake to interact with the Na'vi and gather information for the human corporation.</p>
